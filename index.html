      <p>
        I’m Krishna, an undergraduate student in Data Science, navigating the intersection of machine learning, mathematics, and financial systems.
        I’m drawn to this space because it reflects the kind of person I am: someone who looks for clarity in complexity, patterns in chaos, and meaning beneath the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        What fascinates me about quantitative finance and machine learning isn’t just the algorithms or the models ,it’s how they enable us to understand uncertainty, predict behavior, and design smarter systems. 
        It’s a blend of logic, art, and foresight. It allows me to combine mathematical rigor with real-world problem-solving and that’s where I feel most at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        But my learning doesn’t end at code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend a lot of time reading from philosophy and psychology to history and finance. Books help me stretch my thinking, reflect, and ask better questions. 
        I believe that a good mind, like good code, must be refactored constantly. It’s through reading and writing that I sharpen mine.
